Svelto Entity Component System 2.0
=====================================

Real Entity-Component-System for c#. Enables to write encapsulated, decoupled, highly efficient, data oriented, cache friendly, multi-threaded, code without pain. Although the framework is platform agnostic (
https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.ECS.Vanilla.Example/) it comes with several unity extensions. 
you can find a working example to learn how to use the framework here:

https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto-ECS-Example

I advise to clone the example repositories separately from the framework one, both under the same Unity project Assets folder.

The perfect companion for Svelto.ECS is Svelto.Tasks to run the logic of the Systems even on other threads!

**_Note: Dear Svelto Users : Although I am committed to help you and write articles as much as I can, I will never be able to keep all the documentation up to date. If you are a happy svelto user and you want to contribute, please feel free to update the github wiki! üôèüëä_**

**Note: don't beat yourself if you find Svelto.ECS hard to use at first. The framework is very light in features, but it forces the use of a new coding paradigm and shifting code paradigm is hard! I will try to clarify all the concepts writing more and more articles**

**Note: The folders Svelto.ECS, Svelto.Tasks and Svelto.Common, where present, are submodules pointing to the relavite repositories. If you find them empty, you need to update them through the submodule command. Check some instructions here: https://github.com/sebas77/Svelto.ECS.Vanilla.Example/wiki**
